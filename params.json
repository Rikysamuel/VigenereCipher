{"name":"Vigenere Cipher","tagline":"Encryption/Decryption Tool","body":"# **Vigenere Cipher**\r\n### is an app that may allow user to encrypt a plain text into some text that have been encrypted. The encryption itself has 4 different methods that can be used to encrypt the text.\r\n\r\n# **How To Encrypt**\r\nJust type any word/sentence you want into the input box (Plain text box) or simply choose from a specific place from your computer. And then input some key for the encryption. To remember, the key you inputted must be the same for encryption/decryption. If the key you used for encryption is different from the key you used for the decryption, then the cipher will not back again into a plain text. There is no way to get back the key from this app if you forgot. So, remember it! After the key inputted, choose a technique and choose the output mode. And then just click Encrypt! button.\r\n\r\n# **How To Decrypt**\r\nThe methods is the same like **How to Encrypt** from the section above. Place the cipher text into the Plain text box or locate the file from your computer, input the key and then click the Decrypt! button.\r\n\r\n# **Save to File**\r\nThe result of encryption/decryption can be saved directly into your computer by clicking \"Save to File\" button.\r\n\r\nNb: you can also reset the process by clicking RESET button","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
